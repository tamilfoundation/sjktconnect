# Changelog

## Sprint 0.1 — Project Scaffold + Reference Data Import (2026-02-25)

### Added
- Django project scaffold with split settings (base/development/production)
- `core` app: AuditLog model with post_save/post_delete signals and request middleware
- `schools` app: Constituency, DUN, School models
- `import_constituencies` management command — imports 222 constituencies and 613 DUNs from Political Constituencies CSV
- `import_schools` management command — imports 528 SJK(T) schools from MOE Excel, with GPS verification CSV override
- 26 tests across 3 test files (models, import_constituencies, import_schools)
- Project infrastructure: requirements.txt, Dockerfile, pytest.ini, .env.example, .gitignore, .dockerignore

### Fixed
- DUN model: changed from `code` as primary key to auto-generated PK with `unique_together = (code, constituency)` — DUN codes like "N01" repeat across all 13 states
- CSV encoding: Political Constituencies CSV uses cp1252, not UTF-8
- MOE Excel format: PARLIMEN/DUN columns contain names only (no codes), added name-based lookup fallback

### Data verification
- 222 constituencies, 613 DUNs, 528 schools imported
- 528/528 schools linked to constituency (100%)
- 513/528 schools linked to DUN (97% — 15 KL schools have no DUN, correct)
- 476/528 GPS coordinates verified from verification CSV
